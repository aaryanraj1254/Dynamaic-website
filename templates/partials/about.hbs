about.html is like a complete recipe book that's already written and can't be changed easily.
about.hbs is like a recipe template that allows you to fill in the blanks with custom data and then generates the complete recipe book (HTML file) for you.
By using Handlebars templates (.hbs files), you can separate the presentation (HTML structure) from the data, making it easier to manage and update your website's content.
